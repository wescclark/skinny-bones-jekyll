# About Me
I am currently a Data Science Fellow in the Insight Program. Once an RNA biochemist by trade and namesake, I decided to dive into data completely after finishing my post-doctoral work in August of 2017. I've currently got a website with my consulting project at **[Panoptica](http://www.panoptica.me)** while attempting to maintain this website as well for other small data science forays.

Sanity check.
